## Hi! Welcome to the Github Repo for my Portfolio Website

## How I made It

I built this website using React with Next.js to leverage the latest features and optimizations for a fast, interactive experience. Deployment was handled via Vercel, enabling seamless CI/CD workflows and efficient scaling for a smooth user experience.

For styling, I utilized several CSS libraries and frameworks to enhance the UI with responsive and accessible components. This approach allowed for consistent design across different devices while maintaining flexibility to adapt and refine as needed.

I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed building it! Feedback is always welcome, let me know what you think!
